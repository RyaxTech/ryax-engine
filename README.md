## ‚≠ê About the project

![screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104617518/167607552-44354081-c7d7-4f65-bc25-fca4aec65967.png)

Ryax is an open-source platform that streamlines the design, deployment, and
monitoring of Cloud automations and APIs.

## ‚öô Built With

The code:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [dependency-injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/index.html)
- [SQLalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org)
- [GRPC](https://grpc.io/)

Around the code:

- [Nix](nixos.org/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)

Deploying Ryax:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

## Getting started with Ryax

We describe here two possible ways to install Ryax.

**On your local machine** : We recommend this option if you wish to test our
product with a minimal amount of configuration steps. You will have to install
a few dependencies.

**On a Kubernetes cluster** : This is the standard and recommended approach. We
recommend this option if you have an available cluster on your hands or if you
want a longer lasting installation for your production needs.

### On a local machine

**TODO we have nix-shell for all the dependencies, but we need to fix it.**

You will need the following dependencies :

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (Or `nix-shell`, although poetry is
  substantially faster)
- [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)

Once these are available on your machine, follow these steps to run a local
Ryax instance.

- Clone [ryax-adm](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-adm/) somewhere and
  `cd` into it.
- Run `poetry install` to generate a virtual environment for python.
- Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment. These last two steps
  can also be replaced by `nix-shell`, although this one can take a while.
- Run `./adm/local_ryax/local-ryax.sh`. This will deploy a Ryax instance on
  your machine with `kind`.
- Connect to `localhost` on your navigator and *voil√†*.

**/!\ Warning** Kind runs a kubernetes instance in a docker container on your
machine, which will expose the NodePorts of the cluster. This may conflict with
ports that would be already used on your machine.

**TODO write how to know which ports are exposed. (Or test a conflict situation)**

### On an existing kube cluster

- Make sure you're on the intended cluster: `kubectl config current-context`
- Get the helm value file: ```{bash}
docker run -v $PWD:/data/volume -u $UID registry-1.ryax.org/dev/ryax-adm:staging init --values volume/ryax_values.yaml
```
- Edit it if needed: `vim ryax_values.yaml # Or your favorite text editor`
- Install: ```{bash}
docker run -v $PWD:/data/volume -u $UID registry-1.ryax.org/dev/ryax-adm:staging apply --values volume/ryax_values.yaml
```

For more details on the configuration, see [our documentation](https://docs.ryax.tech/howto/install_ryax_kubernetes.html).
