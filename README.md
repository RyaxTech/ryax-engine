## ‚≠ê About the project

![screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104617518/167607552-44354081-c7d7-4f65-bc25-fca4aec65967.png)

Ryax is an open-source platform that streamlines the design, deployment, and
monitoring of Cloud automations and APIs.

## ‚öô The source code

Ryax is composed of multiple micro-services and tools. To learn more about the internal architecture, see [the documentation](https://docs.ryax.tech/reference/architecture.html). The main components are:

**User interfaces**
 - [cli](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-cli.git): The CLI to command Ryax
 - [front](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-front.git): The WebUI.
 - [adm](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-adm.git): The Ryax ADMinistrationn tool. To install, update, backup and more.

**Micro-services**
 - [authorization](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-authorization.git): Answer to the question: "do you have the rights to do so?".
 - [repository](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-repository.git): Scan git repositories to find actions.
 - [runner](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-runner.git): A trigger or an action run? It handles it.
 - [studio](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-studio.git): Handles the edition of workflows.
 - [action-builder](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-action-builder.git): Builds actions and triggers.
 - [ryax-action-wrappers](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-action-wrappers.git): The code between the action code and Ryax.

**Other**
 - [default-actions](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/workflows/default-actions.git): Some open-source actions and triggers.
 - [errored-actions](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/errored-actions.git): Actions with errors, very useful to test the robustness of Ryax.
 - [common-helm-charts](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/common-helm-charts): Set of common templates for Ryax services library charts

**Main technologies used by Ryax**

The code: **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**, [dependency-injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/index.html), [SQLalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org), [GRPC](https://grpc.io/).

Around the code: [Nix](nixos.org/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/).

Deploying Ryax: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/).


## ‚ö° Getting started with Ryax

### On a local machine

We recommend this option if you wish to test our product with a minimal amount of configuration steps, and if you have enough RAM (~3GB) available.

You need the following dependencies :
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)
- [Helm-diff](https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff) plugin: `helm plugin add https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff`
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (Or `nix-shell`, although poetry is
  substantially faster)
- [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)

Once these are available on your machine:

1) Clone [ryax-adm](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-adm/) and
  `cd` into the repo's root.
2) Generate a virtual environment for python
```bash
poetry install
```
3) Activate this virtual environment
```bash
poetry shell
```
4) Run `./local_ryax/local-ryax.sh` to deploy a Ryax instance on
  your machine with `kind`. It takes a while.
5) Connect to `http://localhost` on your web browser and *voil√†*.

**/!\ Warning** To make it easier for you to access the cluster from your
browser, we expose the ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) on your local machine.
Make sure these aren't already used!

### On an existing Kubernetes cluster

This is the standard and recommended approach.

1) Make sure you're on the intended cluster:
```bash
kubectl config current-context
```
2) Clone [ryax-adm](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-adm/) and
  `cd` into the repo's root.
3) Generate a virtual environment for python
```bash
poetry install
```
4) Activate this virtual environment
```bash
poetry shell
```
5) Get a basic configuration for your new cluster
```bash
ryax-adm init
```
3) Edit it if needed:
```bash
vim ryax_values.yaml # Or your favorite text editor
```
4) Install:
```bash
ryax-adm apply --values volume/ryax_values.yaml --suppress-diff
```
5) Get the external IP of Ryax, and connect to it on your browser:
```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get svc traefik
```

For more details on the configuration, see [our documentation](https://docs.ryax.tech/howto/install_ryax_kubernetes.html).
